I learned that git is pretty tricky and I'll need to work with it more to fully understand what's going on

Elevator Pitch:
Introducing the ultimate love calculator app - a simple and easy way to calculate the compatibility of you and your significant other. Simply enter your names and birthdays and let the app do the rest. It's the perfect tool for anyone looking to gauge the strength of their relationship and take the next step in their love story.

Key features:
Space for names and birthdays. Then a percentage of how compatible they are along with a short description of how their relationship would be.

from the simon project i was able to see how html works better and i was able to change up the simon game from what the cs260 example was originally.

from the css project using simon i was able to see how big of a visual difference css makes. i will definately be using more in the future.

using html and css for the startup project i have learned that it requires a lot of small changes and going back and forth with your code to try and get what you want.

learned a lot from the js addition and saw how useful it is for storing data and making things actually happen.

Im learning that js requires a lot of trial and error when youre trying to implement something new

Ive learned about endpoints from the new implementation of the simon application
